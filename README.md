**School Management System**

This Java project simulates a basic school management system, handling student and teacher information, fees, and salaries.

**Features:**

* **Student Management:**
    * Create new student entries with unique IDs, names, and grades.
    * Track fees paid by each student.
    * Calculate remaining fees.
* **Teacher Management:**
    * Create new teacher entries with IDs, names, and salaries.
    * Track salary earned by each teacher.
* **School Finances:**
    * Track total money earned from student fees.
    * Track total money spent on teacher salaries.

**Technology Stack:**

* Java: The primary programming language for building the application.
* Java Collections Framework (ArrayList): Used to manage lists of students and teachers.

**How to Run:**

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system (check: `java -version` in your terminal).
2. Compile the Java source files (`main.java`, `student.java`, `teacher.java`, `school.java`) using a Java compiler (e.g., `javac main.java student.java teacher.java school.java`). This will create class files.
3. Run the application using the `java` command: `java main`

**Example Usage:**

The `main` class demonstrates creating student and teacher objects, adding them to the school, processing student fee payments, paying teacher salaries, and displaying information.
